# v0.1 Scope and Release Notes

This page records the draft release scope, deferred items, and release-note content used by the v0.1 connectathon readiness guide.

## v0.1 Scope Statement

PH eReferral IG v0.1 defines a minimum FHIR R4 referral path for testing an electronic referral from an initiating facility to a receiving facility. The minimum path uses ServiceRequest for the referral request and Task for workflow state tracking, with supporting Patient, PractitionerRole, Organization, Condition, Observation, Encounter, Provenance, MedicationAdministration, and Immunization examples where available.

v0.1 is a draft testing baseline. It is not a production deployment specification.
